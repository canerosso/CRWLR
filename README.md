# CRWLR

CRWLR is a web app that assists users in planning food crawling events. It was my mod 2 project during my time at Flatiron School and it was built with [Ken Averbookh](https://github.com/kenave). Our locations data is provided by an open dataset provided by Yelp. We used only the Las Vegas locations.

# Video Walkthrough and Demo

# Tidbits and Setup 

* Ruby Version: 2.6.1
* Rails Version: 6.0.1
* Be sure to run all the migrations and seed files before starting up up the project so that when the project is loaded up, the locations for restaurants and bars are available to you.
